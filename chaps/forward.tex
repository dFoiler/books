These are lectures notes of a course that I gave in Tel Aviv University. The aim of these notes is to present the theory of the representations of $\op{GL}(2,K)$ where $K$ is a finite field. However, the presentation of the material has in mind the theory of infinite-dimensional representations of $\op{GL}(2,K)$ for local fields $K$.

I am very grateful to Moshe Jarden who took these notes and worked them out. Without him, it would have been completely impossible to prepare them.

This course and its notes are the first outcome of the Cissie \& Aaron Beare Chair in Algebra and Number Theory.
